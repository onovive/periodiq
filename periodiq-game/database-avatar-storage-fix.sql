-- Fix Avatar Storage RLS Policies
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects;

-- Create proper RLS policies with user ownership checks
-- Allow public read access to all avatars
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to update files in their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete files in their own folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
